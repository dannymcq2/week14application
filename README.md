## Description

Write and view written notes.

I wanted to make a CMS style blog site. This can offer an alternative to post a blog somewhere that is not a big social media platform. It can help give a place to rant that may not have many people view it.
This has helped me learn more about the seed.js file.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
